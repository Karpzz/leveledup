- Run tests: `npm test`
- Check linting: `npm run lint`

### 3. Before Submitting
- Rebase your branch with upstream: `git pull --rebase upstream main`
- Run all tests again
- Ensure your code is properly formatted
- Update your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

### 4. Pull Request
- Create a PR from your fork to the main repository
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link any related issues
- Request review from at least one maintainer

## Code Standards
